## The Controversy Behind Cereal...

Did you know, that in 2019, over 284 million Americans ate breakfast cereals? I'm sure you and I know that feeling of cold delicious milk, paired with our cereal of choice. However, there is an interesting question that many fail to consider...

### What came first, the cereal or the milk?

By common convention those who eat cereal first shuffle the cereal into their bowl, followed by pouring in the milk. But what about you, the reader?
In fact, I'd like you to go to [poll link](http://www.quibblo.com/quiz/bvJi9qK/What-do-you-put-in-first-the-cereal-or-the-milk) and fill out the poll.

2.or cereal first?

It comes down to how you enjoy your cereal. When putting the cereal first, you get a _more balanced cereal to milk ratio_, and you can continuously add additional milk at your discretion. However, when it comes down to your cereal, the cereal itself gets wet and soggy in the milk quickly.

On the other hand, if you pour your milk first, your cereal sits atop the milk. As a result, it doesn't get soggy as quickly, and stays relatively hard and crunchy throughout your meal.

As a result, it comes down to your personal preference. Do you enjoy **crunchier cereal**, or **soggier cereal**? However, logically I would argue that pouring milk first may be the more logical decision. After all, cereal is meant to be crunchy; soggy Cinnamon Toast Crunch certainly seems undersirable. Regardless of my opinions, I would recommend you to take a shot. Perhaps change up your cereal routine next time you grab those Cheerios. Never hurts to try.
